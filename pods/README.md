# Pods game

This game is inspired by the CodingGame `Coders Strike Back`.

It features two pods, controlled in thrust and angle, that need to pass through several waypoints before the other.

- The initial state is the position of all waypoints
- Player input is the thrust and angle of the pod
- Player feedback is the current position of the pod and of the opponent
